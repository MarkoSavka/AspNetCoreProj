A small, non-ideal project focused on personnel management. The technologies used include Asp.Net Core and React.
The backend part has correctly set up authentication and authorization, configured endpoints, and gateway implementation using Ocelot.
The frontend is simple, featuring a router implemented using Material-UI and SweetAlert, providing a clean and user-friendly interface.
While the project may not be perfect, it effectively demonstrates the integration of modern technologies and solid foundational principles in web development.
